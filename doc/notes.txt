notes 

after getting a python 3 environment running

requirements:
	pco_sdk
	pco_camera 
	numpy
	ctypes
	threading
	tkinter
	PIL
	h5py - for data saving in chunks 

old requirements:
	X tifffile
		this was tricky, have to run 'pip3 install --upgrade pyinstaller'
		ended up being able to do this in PIL

saving the data 

	using .npy 
	tifffile 'bigtiff' makes the multipage unviewable... this could be a software viewing issue 

using memory efficiently 
	
	- i'm using this buffer variable (from python2) as a memory view of the data from the camera coming from C 
	- the mistake i'm making here is then copying that data to a queue for analysis, writing to disk, and preview-- i have to build a queue, but if there is a way to point to this queue without copying in subsequent actions, that would be ideal. 
		- maybe don't numpy-onize the buffers when saving, just save the raw buffer or transfer data from the queue (by popping) to the open file chunk 

dtypes
	showing the reshaped buffer array (with byteswapping) as a np.uint8, we get to our 0 (black) to 2^8 / 255 (white) scale for an image 

for previewing, seems we can't do a view operation, have to copy

TkInter example
	https://gordonlesti.com/use-tkinter-without-mainloop/

"The deque's append(), appendleft(), pop(), popleft(), and len(d) operations are thread-safe in CPython."

Concurrency
	https://www.pythonsheets.com/notes/python-concurrency.html

	class myThread(threading.Thread):

	def __init__(self, queue):
		threading.Thread.__init__(self)
		self.queue = queue

	def run():
		while True:
			...
			queue.pop()

	t = myThread(queue)
	t.start()
	# calls run 

	t = threading.Thread(target = my_function)
	# replaces run()


	m = threading.Lock() mutual exclusion

	m.acquire()
	try:
		# critical statements  
	finally:
		m.release()

	or

	with m: 
		# critical statements 

	~~

	e = threading.Event()
	e.isSet() # True if event is set 
	e.set()
	e.clear()
	e.wait()

	Processes don't share memory, they are isolated
		no locks
		have to use pipes, etc to pass messages 


	deque is threadsafe for append and popleft() -- possibly for all four in 3.x

thread values

	any combo of Daemon=True and join() seems to work 

	I think setting Daemon to true means when the main program finishes, 
	the Damon threads are killed 

	in our case, we're breaking the threads manually, but in future we
	might want a daemon thread cleaning the cue regardless of the preview
	state (an option where we can turn the preview on and off with argparse)

	right now, the whole program depends on the preview object being alive, 
	the flag for which is 'sync'-- let's change this to run everything from the 
	get-go, then an option to turn preview on/off and keep taking data 

	for this, we would need daemon processes to run regardless of the 
	main program
	    perhaps a recursive 'input()' call to toggle? 


	Some threads do background tasks, like sending keepalive packets, 
	or performing periodic garbage collection, or whatever. These are only 
	useful when the main program is running, and it's okay to kill them 
	off once the other, non-daemon, threads have exited.

	Without daemon threads, you'd have to keep track of them, 
	and tell them to exit, before your program can completely quit. 
	By setting them as daemon threads, you can let them run and 
	forget about them, and when your program quits, any daemon threads 
	are killed automatically.
